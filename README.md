# GamblingUnityGame
Gambling Game Build in Unity for a programming challenge.

The challenge details are located in the 'Unity Gambling Game Prompt.pdf'

This repo only has the scripts associated with said game as I would need to use Github Large File to upload the entire project.

The project is being hosted on my website at https://andrewrussell.dev/GamblingGame/index.html for you to see for yourself.
There is an warning message that will be displayed when you start the project. You are safe to ignore it, it stems from how my apache server is setup but I couldn't fix it quickly so that will have to be fixed at a later date.

There is an associated writeup in 'Gambling Game Writeup.pdf' in which I talk about my design decisions with the project. Please feel free to read this to gain insight into my thought process. The rights to all the assets is linked in this document aswell (they are all open source for projects of this scope).

Thanks for reading and please reach out if there's anything you notice that should be changed in my project.
